# LocoPipe

LocoPipe is a simple tool that you can use to integrate into a simple Localization pipeline.

The idea is that it takes a (tab|comma)-delimited file with specific column titles, and converts them into Localizable.strings files, set up in the way that Apple likes them (i.e. the <language>.lproj folder structure.)


usage:

`locopipe -i inputFilename.tsv
